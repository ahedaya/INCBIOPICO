System on Chip for the Next Pandemic
Summary
The goal of this research is to take advantage of today's technology in the implementation of robust, inclusive sensor systems that are compatible with of wearable/portable devices. The System on Chip (SoC), detects temperature, impedance, and changes in light absorption on a low-power, low-area integrated chip that includes power management, data transmitting, and initial processing blocks. The processing block aims to remove inaccuracies due to skin pigmentation, environment temperature, and movement using active feedback.
